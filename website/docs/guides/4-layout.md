Vue NodeGui uses a layout system to automatically arrange child components within a component to ensure that they make good use of the available space.

## Fixed Dimensions

A component's height and width determine its size on the screen. The simplest way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed width and height to style. Setting dimensions this way is common for components that should always render at exactly the same size, regardless of screen dimensions.

```html
<!-- App.vue -->

<template>
    <vn-view :style="viewStyle">
        <vn-text>Hello there!üëãüèΩ </vn-text>
    </vn-view>
</template>

<script>
    export default {
        setup() {
            return {
                viewStyle: `
                    width:50px;
                    height:30px;
                    background-color: yellow;
                `
            }
        }
    }
</script>
```

## Dynamic Layouts

Dynamic layouts automatically position and resize components when the amount of space available for them changes, ensuring that they are consistently arranged and that the user interface as a whole remains usable.

Vue NodeGui currently supports creating layouts using FlexLayout.

## FlexLayout

FlexLayout allows the children to expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use `flex: 1`, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the flex given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.

> A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than 0. If a parent does not have either a fixed width and height or flex, the parent will have dimensions of 0 and the flex children will not be visible.

Flexbox is designed to provide a consistent layout on different screen sizes. You will normally use a combination of flex-direction, align-items,and justify-content to achieve the right layout.

### Example:

Lets say you want to build a UI that has a parent view which has two child components. One a label with text Hello and another a view with background color white. Now you want the label to occupy 1/3 of the available height while the white colored child view to occupy the remaining 2/3 height.
